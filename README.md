> **"Models are born production-ready"**

Born is a modern deep learning framework for Go, inspired by [Burn](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn) (Rust). Build ML models in pure Go and deploy as single binaries - no Python runtime, no complex dependencies.

**Project Status**: 🎉 **v0.1.0 Initial Release!** (MNIST: 97.44% MLP, 98.18% CNN - production-ready)

*Celebrating 16 years of Go (2009-2025) with production-ready ML* 🎂

---

## Why Born?

### The Problem
Deploying ML models is hard:
- Python runtime required
- Complex dependency management
- Large Docker images
- Slow startup times
- Integration friction with Go backends

### The Born Solution
```go
import "github.com/born-ml/born"

// Models "born" ready for production
model := born.Load("resnet50.born")
prediction := model.Predict(image)

// That's it. No Python. No containers. Just Go.
```

**Benefits**:
- Single binary deployment
- Fast startup (< 100ms)
- Small memory footprint
- Native Go integration
- Cross-platform out of the box

---

## Features

- **Pure Go** - No CGO dependencies, trivial cross-compilation
- **Type Safe** - Generics-powered API for compile-time guarantees
- **Multiple Backends** - CPU (SIMD), CUDA, Vulkan, Metal, WebGPU
- **Autodiff** - Automatic differentiation via decorators
- **Production Ready** - ONNX support, quantization, serving
- **WebAssembly** - Run inference in browsers natively
- **Single Binary** - Models embedded in executables

---

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/born-ml/born.git
cd born

# Build
make build

# Or install CLI
make install
```

### Development Setup

**Requirements**:
- Go 1.25+
- Make (optional, but recommended)
- golangci-lint (for linting)

**Build**:
```bash
make build          # Build all binaries
make test           # Run tests
make lint           # Run linter
make bench          # Run benchmarks
```

### Example: MNIST Classification

**Working example included!** See `examples/mnist/` for complete implementation.

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/born-ml/born/internal/autodiff"
    "github.com/born-ml/born/internal/backend/cpu"
    "github.com/born-ml/born/internal/nn"
)

func main() {
    // Create backend with autodiff
    backend := autodiff.New(cpu.New())

    // Define model (784 → 128 → 10)
    model := NewMNISTNet(backend)

    // Create loss and optimizer
    criterion := nn.NewCrossEntropyLoss(backend)
    optimizer := optim.NewAdam(model.Parameters(), optim.AdamConfig{
        LR:    0.001,
        Betas: [2]float32{0.9, 0.999},
    }, backend)

    // Training loop
    for epoch := range 10 {
        // Forward pass
        logits := model.Forward(batch.ImagesTensor)
        loss := criterion.Forward(logits, batch.LabelsTensor)

        // Backward pass
        optimizer.ZeroGrad()
        grads := backend.Backward(loss.Raw())
        optimizer.Step(grads)

        // Log progress
        acc := nn.Accuracy(logits, batch.LabelsTensor)
        fmt.Printf("Epoch %d: Loss=%.4f, Accuracy=%.2f%%\n",
            epoch, loss.Raw().AsFloat32()[0], acc*100)
    }
}
```

**Run it:** `cd examples/mnist && go run .`

**Phase 1 includes:**
- ✅ Tensor operations (Add, MatMul, Reshape, etc.)
- ✅ Automatic differentiation with gradient tape
- ✅ Neural network modules (Linear, ReLU, activations)
- ✅ Optimizers (SGD with momentum, Adam with bias correction)
- ✅ CrossEntropyLoss with numerical stability (log-sum-exp trick)
- ✅ Full MNIST training example

## Architecture

### Backend Abstraction

Born uses a backend interface for device independence:

```go
type Backend interface {
    Add(a, b *RawTensor) *RawTensor
    MatMul(a, b *RawTensor) *RawTensor
    // ... other operations
}
```

**Available Backends:**

| Backend | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| CPU | Planned | Pure Go with SIMD optimizations |
| CUDA | Planned | NVIDIA GPU via direct driver calls |
| Vulkan | Planned | Cross-platform GPU compute |
| Metal | Planned | Apple GPU (macOS/iOS) |
| WebGPU | Planned | Modern browser GPU |

### Decorator Pattern

Functionality composed via decorators (inspired by Burn):

```go
// Basic backend
base := cpu.New()

// Add autodiff
withAutodiff := autodiff.New(base)

// Add kernel fusion
optimized := fusion.New(withAutodiff)

// Your code works with any backend!
model := createModel(optimized)
```

### Type Safety with Generics

```go
type Tensor[T DType, B Backend] struct {
    raw     *RawTensor
    backend B
}

// Compile-time type checking
func (t *Tensor[float32, B]) MatMul(other *Tensor[float32, B]) *Tensor[float32, B]
```

## Philosophy

### "Born Ready"

Models trained anywhere (PyTorch, TensorFlow) are **imported** and **born** production-ready:

```
Training → Birth → Production
 (Burn)    (Born)    (Run)

PyTorch trains  →  Born imports  →  Born deploys
TensorFlow trains → Born imports → Born deploys
Born trains    →  Born ready   →  Born serves
```

### Production First

- **Single Binary**: Entire model in one executable
- **No Runtime**: No Python, no dependencies
- **Fast Startup**: < 100ms cold start
- **Small Memory**: Minimal footprint
- **Cloud Native**: Natural fit for Go services

### Developer Experience

- **Type Safe**: Catch errors at compile time
- **Clean API**: Intuitive and ergonomic
- **Great Docs**: Comprehensive documentation
- **Easy Deploy**: `go build` and you're done

## FAQ

**Q: Why not use Gorgonia?**
A: Gorgonia is great but uses a different approach. Born focuses on modern Go (generics), pure Go (no CGO), and production-first design inspired by Burn.

**Q: When will it be ready?**
A: Phase 1 (CPU, basic training) targeted for Q1 2026. Follow development on GitHub.

**Q: Can I use PyTorch models?**
A: Yes! Via ONNX import (Phase 3). Train in PyTorch, deploy with Born.

**Q: WebAssembly support?**
A: Yes! Pure Go compiles to WASM natively. Inference in browsers out of the box.

**Q: How can I help?**
A: Watch this space! Contributing guide coming soon.
